## Subject Description – ITC C508: ITE Elective 4

ITC C508 focuses on foundational and applied concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The course introduces core techniques for processing, analyzing, and understanding human language data, alongside modern approaches to model training and evaluation. Throughout the subject, students explore essential algorithms, text preprocessing methods, vectorization techniques, and model development workflows relevant to contemporary NLP systems.

A part of the course emphasizes transformer-based architectures, including models such as BERT, which represent current state-of-the-art methods for language understanding. Students gain hands-on experience implementing and experimenting with these models, enabling them to develop practical skills in tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and semantic similarity.

The subject combines theoretical foundations with application-oriented work, preparing students to design, evaluate, and refine intelligent systems that leverage machine-learned language representations. By the end of the course, learners are equipped with the technical background and practical competencies necessary to engage with modern machine learning workflows and advanced NLP techniques.


This repository contains my complete set of outputs for ITC C508 – ITE Elective 4.  
All activities, quizzes, examinations, and project materials are organized by major course phases to ensure clarity, version control, and ease of reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:

```
Prelim/
Midterm/
Finals/
```

Each section contains subfolders representing the individual activities or assessments assigned during that period.  
Inside every activity folder are two primary components:

1. **The activity, quiz, or exam submission**  
2. **A reflection file (`reflection.md`)** documenting insights, challenges, and learnings I had for that task

## Why is my portfolio on GitHub:

My academic portfolio is hosted on **GitHub** to provide a centralized, accessible, and professional platform for showcasing completed coursework. GitHub was chosen for several key reasons:

- **Accessibility:** GitHub allows easy access from anywhere, making it convenient to share the portfolio with instructors, peers, or potential employers.  
- **Organization:** Repository structure and folder hierarchy enable clear documentation of all activities, quizzes, exams, and projects in one place.  
- **Professional Presentation:** GitHub is widely recognized in the tech industry, providing a professional context for demonstrating technical and reflective work.  
- **Portfolio Integration:** Hosting on GitHub allows seamless inclusion of code, documents, and Markdown reflections, supporting both academic and career development purposes.  

By using GitHub, this portfolio not only documents the learning journey for ITC C508 but also presents it in a structured, professional, and easily shareable manner.
