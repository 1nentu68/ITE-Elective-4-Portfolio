        "# Sentiment Analysis Experiments: Summary and Results\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook details a series of experiments to train and evaluate a sentiment analysis model on user suggestion data. The primary objective was to classify feedback into three categories (Negative, Neutral, Positive) while effectively addressing a significant class imbalance in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "The project followed a structured approach from data preparation to model evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The raw text data was thoroughly cleaned by:\n",
        "    *   Converting all text to lowercase.\n",
        "    *   Removing boilerplate text like \"none\", \"n/a\", and \"wala\".\n",
        "    *   Stripping out URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n",
        "    *   Eliminating both English and Tagalog stopwords to reduce noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Model Selection**: The `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased` model from Hugging Face was selected as the base for fine-tuning. This model is well-suited for multilingual text, making it robust for this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Addressing Class Imbalance**: To counteract the skewed data distribution, class weights were calculated and applied during training using a custom `WeightedLossTrainer`. This forced the model to pay more attention to the underrepresented classes, preventing it from becoming biased towards the majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Dataset Splitting**: The cleaned dataset was split into training (72%), validation (18%), and testing (10%) sets to ensure a robust evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hyperparameter Tuning Experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "Four experiments were conducted, each running for 10 epochs, to find the optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning the model. The key parameters adjusted were `per_device_train_batch_size`, `weight_decay`, and `warmup_steps`.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Experiment 1** delivered the best performance, achieving the highest F1-score and accuracy on the test set. The combination of a batch size of 16, a weight decay of 0.01, and no warmup steps proved to be the most effective configuration for this task.\n",

        "    This experiment served as a strong baseline and ultimately produced the best-performing model. The configuration represents a \"sweet spot\" of well-balanced hyperparameters. A batch size of 16 is large enough to provide stable gradient updates but small enough to allow for good generalization. The minimal weight decay of 0.01 likely provided just enough regularization to prevent overfitting without hindering the model's ability to learn complex patterns. The fact that zero warmup steps worked best indicates that the initial learning rate was appropriate and the model could begin learning effectively from the very first step.\n",

        "    This experiment tested the effect of halving the batch size and removing weight decay. The smaller batch size increases the number of weight updates per epoch, which can sometimes help a model find a better minimum but can also introduce noise. In this case, the slightly lower performance suggests the more frequent, noisier updates led to slightly poorer generalization compared to Experiment 1. Furthermore, this was the slowest experiment to train, demonstrating the direct trade-off between batch size and training time.\n",

        "    This setup was identical to the best-performing Experiment 1, with the sole addition of 200 warmup steps. A learning rate warmup is often used to stabilize training in the initial stages by preventing large, potentially disruptive updates. However, the fact that this model's performance was slightly worse than Experiment 1 suggests that a warmup was unnecessary. The initial learning rate was stable enough on its own, and the warmup phase offered no discernible benefit, slightly impeding the model from reaching its optimal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Key Takeaway**: A learning rate warmup is a useful tool but not always a requirement. Its necessity is dependent on the dataset and initial learning rate stability.\n"

        "    This experiment was notable because it achieved the highest score on the **validation set** during training (99.45% F1 at Epoch 8) and was the fastest to run. However, this superior validation performance did not translate to the final test set, where its score dropped to match the other sub-optimal experiments. This is a classic example of minor overfitting to the validation data. The combination of a large batch size and heavy regularization created a model that was excellent at predicting the validation split but had slightly less general knowledge for the completely unseen test data.\n",

        "*   **Key Takeaway**: The best performance on the validation set does not always guarantee the best performance on the test set. This underscores the critical importance of a final, held-out test set for true model evaluation."
