        "This initial code block serves as the foundational setup for the entire project. Its purpose is to install and upgrade the essential Python libraries required for building and evaluating a sophisticated sentiment analysis model. The `transformers` library from Hugging Face is critical, as it provides the pre-trained models (like DistilBERT) and the tools to fine-tune them. The `datasets` library is used for efficiently loading and processing the data, while `evaluate` provides standardized metrics, such as the F1-score, for assessing the model's performance. Executing this cell ensures that the environment has the correct and most recent versions of these dependencies, preventing potential conflicts or errors in the subsequent code."

This is done to ensure consistency and to prevent the model from treating the same word with different capitalization (e.g., \"Good,\" \"good,\" and \"GOOD\") as distinct entities. By standardizing the text, we reduce the complexity of the vocabulary the model needs to learn, which generally leads to better performance and faster training.\n",

Finally, calling `df.tail()` allows for a quick inspection of the last few rows of the DataFrame, confirming that the lowercase transformation was applied correctly across the entire dataset."

        "3.  **Systematic Cleaning Pipeline:** A chain of well-defined functions is used to methodically clean the text. This includes normalizing whitespace, removing URLs and personal information, collapsing elongated words (e.g., \"goood\" to \"good\"), and stripping out irrelevant symbols and emojis. This structured approach ensures that each text sample is processed consistently.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Training Set (`train_dataset`):** This is the biggest chunk of the data. The model will look at these examples over and over again to learn the patterns of what makes a suggestion positive, negative, or neutral. This is like the textbook and homework problems I study from.\n",
        "2.  **Validation Set (`val_dataset`):** During the training process, the model will be tested on this set after each epoch (a full pass through the training data). It's like a practice quiz. It helps me see if the model is actually learning or just memorizing the training data (which is called overfitting). The results from this set will guide the hyperparameter tuning process to find the best model.\n",
        "3.  **Test Set (`test_dataset`):** This is the final exam. The model never sees this data during training or validation. I'll only use it once at the very end to get an honest, unbiased score of how well my final model will perform on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "I used `train_test_split` twice to create this three-way split, which is a standard technique. I also made sure to set `random_state=42`, which is super important for reproducibility. It means that every time I run this code, the data will be split in the exact same way. Finally, I converted each of these pandas DataFrames into a `Dataset` object, which is the specific format that the Hugging Face `Trainer` needs to work with."

So, this is where I calculate a \"penalty\" for the model if it gets the rare classes wrong.\n",

It looks at my training data (`train_dataset['ground_truth']`) and figures out the right weights. The classes with very few samples get a high weight, and the class with tons of samples gets a low weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output is a dictionary, `class_weights_dict`. This dictionary is super important because I'm going to feed it directly into my custom `WeightedLossTrainer` later. When the model is training, if it misclassifies an example from an underrepresented class, the loss (or error) will be multiplied by its higher weight. This forces the model to pay much more attention to getting the minority classes right, which should lead to a much fairer and more accurate model overall. It's a clever way to handle imbalanced data without having to collect more samples."

        "First, I load the `AutoTokenizer` for `'distilbert-base-multilingual-cased'`. I chose this specific model because my dataset contains both English and Tagalog, so a multilingual model is essential. The tokenizer's job is to take my sentences and chop them up into \"tokens,\" which are then converted into numerical IDs from a fixed vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "I defined a `tokenize_function` to handle this process. Inside it, I made sure everything is a string to avoid errors. The key part is the call to `DistilBertTokenizer`, where I set `truncation=True` and `padding=\"max_length\"`. This is super important because BERT models require all input sequences to have the exact same length. My function ensures every suggestion becomes a sequence of 128 tokens, either by cutting it down or adding padding tokens. I also made sure to include the `ground_truth` labels in the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, I used the `.map()` method to apply this function across all my data splits (train, validation, and test). Using `batched=True` makes this process incredibly fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I loaded the actual `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`. This line downloads the pre-trained DistilBERT model, which has already learned a lot about language from a huge amount of text. The most critical part for me was setting `num_labels=3`. This tells the model that I want to adapt it for my specific task, which has three sentiment categories. It adds a new, untrained classification layer on top of the powerful base model, and it's this new layer that I'll be fine-tuning on my dataset. After running this cell, my data is perfectly formatted, and my model is ready to start learning."

Just looking at accuracy can be misleading, especially with my imbalanced dataset. So, I'm telling the `Trainer` to use the **weighted F1-score**. This function takes the model's raw output (logits), converts them into predictions, and compares them to the true labels to calculate the F1-score. The `Trainer` will automatically call this function to evaluate the model on the validation set.\n",

I'm creating my own version of the `Trainer` that uses a special loss function. I've programmed it to apply the weights, so if the model makes a mistake on a rare sentiment class, the \"penalty\" (loss) is much higher. This forces the model to pay extra attention to the minority classes. It feels cool to be able to customize a core part of the `transformers` library to fit my specific problem.\n",

This ensures there's no \"cheating\" and that each experiment starts from the exact same baseline.\n",

While it was running, it was fascinating to watch. For each trial, a new model was trained, and I could see the F1-score on the validation set changing. Some trials were even \"pruned\" early, which I learned is an optimization by Optuna to stop wasting time on combinations that are obviously not performing well.\n",

        "1.  **The F1-Score is incredibly high!** An F1-score of 0.989 is amazing and gives me a lot of confidence that my approach—from the detailed data cleaning to using a multilingual model and handling class imbalance—was effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`per_device_train_batch_size: 16`**: The search landed on the middle value I provided. This suggests that a batch size of 8 might have been too small and made the training process too noisy, while 32 might have been too large, causing the model to generalize a little less effectively. A batch size of 16 seems to be the \"Goldilocks\" value for my dataset, providing a good balance between stable learning and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`weight_decay: 0.1`**: This is a really important insight. The grid search chose the *highest* value I offered for weight decay. Weight decay is a regularization technique that prevents overfitting. This result strongly suggests that my model had a tendency to memorize the training data, and applying a strong penalty for complexity forced it to learn more robust, generalizable patterns. This is a perfect practical example of why regularization is so critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`warmup_steps: 0`**: This result was surprising. I thought a learning rate \"warm-up\" period was always a good idea to help the model's stability. However, the best performance came from disabling it entirely. This could mean that for this specific dataset and the DistilBERT model, the default learning rate schedule was effective right from the start. It’s a great reminder that while there are \"best practices,\" you always have to test them against your actual data.\n",

        "This whole process was incredibly valuable. Instead of just guessing, I now have a set of hyperparameters that are empirically proven to be the best for my specific task out of all the combinations I tested. I can now move forward with confidence and use these exact settings to train my final model on the full training dataset."

        "After the Grid Search, this cell felt like a smarter, more targeted way to find the best hyperparameters. Instead of testing every single combination, I used a **Random Search**. The goal was to see if I could find an equally good (or even better) set of settings more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "There were a few key differences in my setup this time:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Smarter Search Space:** For `weight_decay`, instead of giving it just three fixed options, I used `trial.suggest_float(..., log=True)`. This allowed Optuna to pick *any* value from a continuous range. It's like fine-tuning a dial instead of just flipping a switch, which gives it the freedom to find more nuanced, optimal values that I would never have thought to try manually.\n",
        "2.  **Fewer Trials:** I set `n_trials=20`, which is less than the 27 trials from the Grid Search. The idea is that a random search can often stumble upon a great combination much faster than a brute-force approach, saving a lot of time and GPU usage.\n",
        "3.  **A Practical Fix:** I added `save_total_limit=1` to the `TrainingArguments`. This was a great lesson in resource management. It tells the Trainer to only save the single best model checkpoint and delete the older ones. This is a lifesaver in environments like Colab where disk space is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analyzing the Results and Implications:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The results from the Random Search were really enlightening:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Best F1-Score: 0.9890**\n",
        "*   **Best Hyperparameters:**\n",
        "    *   `per_device_train_batch_size`: 16\n",
        "    *   `weight_decay`: 0.24847...\n",
        "    *   `warmup_steps`: 0\n",
        "\n",
        "The most striking takeaway is that the **F1-score is virtually identical to the best score from the Grid Search**, but I achieved it with fewer trials (20 vs. 27). This proves how much more efficient a Random Search can be.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results also reinforced my earlier findings. The optimal `batch_size` was again 16, and the best `warmup_steps` was again 0. This consistency gives me very high confidence that these are the right settings for my model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most interesting result was the `weight_decay`. The search landed on a very specific value, `0.248...`, which is quite high. I would never have discovered this precise value with a grid search. This confirms that strong regularization is crucial for my model, and it shows the power of letting the search explore the \"in-between\" values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this experiment was a huge success. It taught me that while Grid Search is thorough, Random Search is often a more practical and efficient strategy for finding excellent hyperparameters, especially when you're working with limited time or resources."
